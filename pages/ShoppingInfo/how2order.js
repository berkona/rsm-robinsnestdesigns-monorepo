          please press the button "add to cart", and follow
          the directions on how to order securely with your credit card
          or PayPal. If you would also like to order an item not on the
          shopping cart system, please fill in the comments area on the
        shopping cart's order form.</p>
  <p>You may also contact Robin Monroe by e-mail (<a href="mailto:robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">robin@robinsnestdesigns.com</a>),
          voice phone<strong>*</strong> (919-471-6576), or snail mail (<Link href="/orderform"><a>order
          form</a></Link>).
          Specify what you would like to order. We will send you an invoice through PayPal. You do not need a PayPal account to pay, but we will need your email address for invoicing. If not in stock, most items
