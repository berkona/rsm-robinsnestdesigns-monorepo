<h1>Shipping Information </h1>
<p>Unlike some businesses, we don't try to make money on Shipping and Handling costs. We charge what it costs us (including packing materials, time, and gas). We try to do this in a way that makes it easy to determine your costs. All this is explained below. </p>
<p>As always, if you have questions, just <a href="mailto:robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">contact us</a>! </p>
<h2>United States </h2>
    <p>All orders are shipped in the <u>United
    States</u> via the US Postal Service at the following
    rates:</p>

    <p>Priority Mail usually takes 2-3 days to get to you. First class mail can take 2-10 days. </p>
    <p>The order amount used to determine  shipping includes any discounts (e.g. $70 of merchandise with a 10% discount does not qualify for free shipping). Also, there are some <a href="#restrictions">restrictions</a> on free shipping.</p>
    <p>The S&amp;H rates listed above and shown on the online
    order form are for shipping to United States addresses and its
    protectorates (i.e. Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.). United States P.O.
    boxes and APO/FPO addresses have these rates too.</p>
    <p>Paper gift certificates are $1.00 to ship in the USA regardless of the amount (or you can use the electronic gift certificates option for no shipping charge). </p>
    <p><strong>North Carolina residents </strong>will need to add sales tax to your orders.</p>

<p><i><font color="#ff0000">We do not ship to Mexico, Nigeria, Columbia, Italy, Spain, or the Middle East due to past problems.</font></i> We may ship to other countries depending on the circumstances. If your country is not listed, please <a href="mailto:robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Note that while most country's postal systems are good and rarely lose packages, it does happen occasionally. We will work with you to find lost packages but reserve the right not to reship items that are not received.</p>

<h2><a name="processing"></a>Order Processing </h2>
<p>In order to keep our costs (and prices) down, we process orders in the following manner:<br></br>
</p>
<h3>How We Fill Your Order </h3>
<p>We now carry over 40,000 items! Unfortunately, we can't possibly stock all items at all times. We simply do not have several warehouses, and our inventory costs would cost you more! We do stock several thousand of the more popular items, but chances are we will have to order one or more items on your order from our <em>FAST</em> suppliers. </p>
<p><u>Help us help you! We place our orders with our distributor early Tuesday afternoon. Please place your order by Tuesday at 12 PM Eastern Time (NOON Eastern Time) so we can ship starting on that Friday</u><i><u>.</u></i> </p>
<p>You may have noticed a change in the check out process. To offset increased card processing costs, we have switched to PayPal for all our credit/debit card processing.   You do not have to have a PayPal account to pay. Select the second option. You can then enter your MC, VISA, AMEX, or Discover card. If you prefer to phone in your order, Robin will send you an invoice so you can pay online. You can also mail in a money order. </p>
<p>Most of our distributors ship to us in 2-5 days.  If possible, we will also have our distributors ship directly to you depending on the circumstances. We try our very best to get your order to you as fast as possible. </p>
<p>If you have special timing needs, please let us know when you place the order either by phone, email or by putting a note in the comments box on your order. <i></i></p>
<p>Note: We try to keep our 40,000 items up to date, but we may not get notified if something is  discontinued or out of print. If there is a particular item you really want but think it might be out of print/discontinued, <a href="mailto:robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">drop us an email and we will be happy to check availability</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When We Ship Domestic Orders </h3>
<p>Most domestic orders are shipped within 2 <u>business</u> days of receipt <u>when all items are in stock</u>. If a few items are out of stock but due to arrive in 5 <u>business</u> days, your order will be held and shipped all together. In the event the out of stock items will take longer to arrive, these items will be backordered and shipped separately with no additional cost to you.</p>
<p>Most domestic packages are received by customers in 2-4 business days from the time they are shipped. Some deliveries can take up to a week. In the rare event your order does not arrive within four weeks from the shipping date, Robin's Nest Designs will ask the post office for assistance and then reship if the package is truly lost. <span class="style2">Your order will not be reshipped until after four weeks of the ship date &amp; the post office has not found your package.</span> Please contact your local post office if your package has taken over a week to get to you. Most of the time, it is being held for you to pick up and the delivery notice was lost. <i><font color="#ff0000">Please allow 4 weeks for delivery before assuming your package is lost.<br></br>
</font></i></p>
<h3>When We Ship International Orders Including Canada </h3>
<p>All international orders are shipped in their entirety only. If you place an international order, it will not be shipped until all items are in stock. International orders are shipped by US Postal Service Priority Mail. The S&amp;H listed is for a <u>flat rate envelop only</u>. If your order will not fit in a flat rate envelop, it will be placed in a bag or box. There is a minimum of a $10 USD charge in addition to the posted shipping charge due to the additional cost of shipping a box or bag.</p>
<p> Your final S&amp;H will be determined as actual shipping charges plus $2 USD for handling or the flat rate price on your order plus $10 USD ($15 for everywhere else). See below. </p>
<p>For example, a  box shipping to Canada has an actual postal charge of $35. The S&amp;H on your order is $17. Because the actual shipping charge is $35, you will be charged $37 ($35 plus $2), not $27 ($17 plus $10). However, if the box has an actual shipping charge of $22, you will be charged $27 ($17 plus $10), not $24 ($24 plus $2). </p>
<p>You will be notified before your order is shipped if your order will not fit in a flat rate envelop and thus requires a box or bag. This charge will not show up on your order. You will be notified by email of this charge prior to shipping. The fee must be paid before your order ships. Please note that if your order will not fit in the flat rate envelop, then, more than likely, it is a large and expensive order. The advantage of shipping your order in a box or bag is that you get tracking and insurance included. There is no tracking and insurance offered with the flat rate envelop. This is usually not a problem with smaller orders. <i><font color="#ff0000">Please allow 4 weeks for delivery before assuming your package is lost.</font></i></p>
<h2><a name="restrictions"></a>Restrictions For Free Shipping </h2>
<p>Free shipping does not apply to items that are heavy, bulky, and/or very fragile. These require special shipping needs to protect them in transit.</p>
<p>Most items we sell do not require this. However, here are some specific items that do:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Magnifiers &amp; Lamps</p>
  <p>All Wooden Frames</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">contact
