<h1>Policies</h1>
<p>Please let us know if you are have a problem with your order within 30 days after purchase. We will work with you to make it right. However, because some people have tried to take advantage of us, we have implemented the following policies:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Return Policy</h2>
<p> Many items are returnable for a 15% restocking fee as long as they are in unused, new condition (i.e., unopened and undamaged) with the <strong>exception</strong> of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Special orders (i.e., items that we do not normally stock)<br></br>
  Bulk cut fabrics (i.e., fabrics that have been cut a specific size for you)<br></br>
  Printed materials (i.e., charts, patterns, books, and kits)</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong>You must obtain prior authorization</strong> from Robin Monroe, owner of Robin's Nest Designs, by <a href="mailto:%20robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">email</a> (<a href="mailto:%20robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">robin@robinsnestdesigns.com</a>) or phone (919-471-6576), <strong>or your return will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<p><a href="mailto:%20robin@robinsnestdesigns.com">Click here</a> to request an RMA by email or call 919-471-6576. Please leave a message that you would like an RMA and give your order number and someone will either return your call or email you the information.</p>
<p>Your authorized return must be packaged in a manner that prevents damage and allows the item(s) to be resellable. Please use padding materials and/or cardboard to protect the items. Items returned in damaged condition that were mailed without proper packaging will not be refunded. We highly recommend using delivery confirmation or tracking for your package. If your package is lost, you will not be refunded.</p>
<p>Refunds are issued for authorized returns up to 30 days after the purchase. <u>No returns are accepted after 30 days.</u> </p>
<p> If you decide you would like to return an item, you are responsible for the return postage. You will be refunded for the item's purchase price less the 15% restocking fee and any adjustments due to sales tax or savings card reward. You will not be refunded the postage to or from Robin's Nest Designs. </p>
<p>Determination if an item can be returned and  the condition of the returned item is left to the sole discretion of Robin Monroe, owner of Robin's Nest Designs. No exceptions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Exchange"></a>Exchange Policy </h2>
<p>If you would like to exchange an item, the same rules apply as for a return (see above). In addition to the above rules, you will be charged to ship the exchange back to you and you will be charged the restocking fee. <u>No exchanges are accepted after 30 days.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="cancellation"></a>Cancellations</h2>
<p> We place our orders with distributors weekly on Tuesday at 12 PM Eastern Time (Noon Eastern Time). If we need to order items for your order, you may cancel or change your order any time prior to Tuesday 12 PM Eastern Time (Noon Eastern Time). Once we have placed our weekly orders, you may NOT cancel or change your order. </p>
